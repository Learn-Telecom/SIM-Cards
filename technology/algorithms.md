# Algorithms

COMP128-1 – original algorithm with known weaknesses&#x20;

COMP128-2 – stronger algorithm which still clears the 10 rightmost bits of Kc&#x20;

COMP128-3 – same algorithm as COMP128-2 with all 64 bits of Kc generated&#x20;

COMP128-4 – based on the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) algorithm “Milenage”, which uses AES

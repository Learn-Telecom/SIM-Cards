# ðŸŸ¢ SIM - Subscriber Identity Module

A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card is a small electronic chip that is used to identify and authenticate a mobile device on a cellular network.&#x20;

It is inserted into the device and contains information such as the phone number, the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), and the Authentication Key (Ki).

The SIM card consists of a small microcontroller, non-volatile memory, and other passive components. The microcontroller is responsible for managing the SIM's functionality and communication with the mobile device.&#x20;

The non-volatile memory stores the data and information that is needed for the SIM card to operate.
